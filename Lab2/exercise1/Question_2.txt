When a button is pressed in the alarm state the alarm will be silenced for a set amount of time or until the user turns off the alarm.

Let p denote the condition that a button is pressed, q denote the condition that the alarm is silenced for a set amount of time, and r denote the condition that the user turns off the alarm.
Let a be the alarm state
