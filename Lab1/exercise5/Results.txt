As you can see from the video, the real-time distance calculation algorithm did not do very well. Although, the accelerometer only moved about 40cm in the y-axis, the display indicated a displacement of 15m in the x-axis, 9m in the y-axis and -5m in the z-axis. Furthermore, even if the accelerometer was left untouched, the positions displayed on the OLED screen would continue to grow making it very unreliable. The major sources of error that contribute to this inaccuracy are related to accelerometer sensor itself. These errors include the two-point calibration not being perfect, the precision of the accelerometer being too low, and drift.
